# **Pipex**

## :speech_balloon: **About**
The mandatory part of this project involves using processes to implement a single pipe for chaining the commands provided as arguments, while also supporting overwrite redirections. The bonus part includes the execution of multiple pipes and implementation of append redirections.

## üíé **Features**
```
- Executes the commands provided as arguments usinge the execve() and fork() functions
- Establishes a pipe between the commands using the pipe() function

## :link: **Compilation**
To compile the program you should run `make`.
This rule will generate an executable file named `pipex`.

To launch the executable you should follow this syntax:

```sh
$ ./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile
```

# Bonus Part

## üíé **Features**
```
- Supports multiple pipes, enabling users to chain multiple commands together
- Supports append redirections (including here document)

## :link: **Compilation**
To compile the program you should run `make bonus`.
This rule will generate an executable file named `bonus`.

To launch the executable you should follow this syntax:

Executes overwrite redirections:

```sh
$ ./bonus infile cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn outfile
```

Executes append redirections:

```sh
$ ./bonus here_doc LIMITER cmd1 cmd2 cmd3 ... cmdn outfile
```
